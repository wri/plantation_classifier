    "## Modifications required\n",
    "\n",
    "* adapt to expect xx input band feature stack. currently expects 17 channels\n",
    "* change the final output layer to support multi-class segmentation with a softmax activation function. currently is sigmoid\n",
    "* adjust input patch size. currently expects 512x512\n",
    "* adjust loss function to be categorical cross-entropy (or Dice loss for imbalanced classes). currently is binary cross-entropy. confirm whether to consider weighted loss function.\n",
    "* model deployment - how large of an area?\n",
    "* model validation - necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updates reflected in `modified_unet.py`\n",
    "* Removed ConvGRU: classification will be done on a single composite images (not monthly time series). No need for RNN/time layers.\n",
    "* Removed SSE and DropBlock: Starting with a simple model. Attention and regularization can be added later if needed.\n",
    "* Switched Binary to Multiclass Output: Instead of \"tree vs no-tree\", your model now predicts 4 classes: Background, Monoculture, Agroforestry, Natural.\n",
    "* Simplified U-Net Encoder-Decoder: Clean, readable U-Net blocks: Conv → ReLU → BatchNorm with skip connections.\n",
    "* Modified Input Channels: Original model expected 17 bands (Sentinel only); your model expects 94 bands (Sentinel + Texture + Tree Features)."
